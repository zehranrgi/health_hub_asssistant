COMMON DRUG INTERACTIONS - CVS PHARMACY SAFETY INFORMATION

=== LISINOPRIL + POTASSIUM SUPPLEMENTS ===
Interaction Level: MAJOR - Avoid combination
Risk: Hyperkalemia (dangerously high potassium levels)
Symptoms: Irregular heartbeat, muscle weakness, slow heart rate

=== ASPIRIN + IBUPROFEN (NSAIDs) ===
Interaction Level: MODERATE - Use with caution
Risk: Increased bleeding risk, stomach ulcers, reduced aspirin heart protection
Why: Both are NSAIDs; combining increases gastrointestinal bleeding risk
Effect: Ibuprofen can block aspirin's heart-protective effects
Recommendation: If taking daily aspirin for heart:
- Take aspirin first, wait 30 minutes before ibuprofen
- Or take ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or 30 minutes after aspirin
- Better alternative: Use acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain instead
